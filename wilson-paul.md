Paul Wilson is a Professor of Nuclear Engineering in the [University of
Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/)â€˜s [Department of Engineering
Physics](http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep), and Faculty Director of the
[Advanced Computing Initiative](http://aci.wisc.edu/). His research
interests bring together technical and policy issues: analysis methods
of isotopic inventories in nuclear systems and the implications on
nuclear non-proliferation policy, and the development of next generation
nuclear power systems to fulfill a role in future energy policy and
needs. Paul joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant
professor in August 2001 as part of the [Energy Systems and Policy
Hiring Initiative](http://www.clusters.wisc.edu/clusters/show/18). Paul
currently serves on the Executive Committee of the [Wisconsin Energy
Institute](http://www.energy.wisc.edu/) and the Steering Committee of
the [Holtz Center for Science and Technology
Studies](http://sts.wisc.edu/).

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta,
Paul specialized in the Nuclear Power option of the [Engineering
Science program](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of
Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/). After receiving his Bachelor of
Applied Science in Engineering Science, he began his graduate
schooling in nuclear engineering at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. After three years, he moved to Karlsruhe, Germany,
where he studied in the Institute for Neutron Physics and Reactor
Engineering (of the [Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology](http://www.kit.edu/)), earning his Dr.-Ing.  degree in
Mechanical Engineering in 1998. Returning to Madison, Paul completed
his Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering in 1999.

Paul was the founding President of the [North American Young Generation
in Nuclear [NA-YGN]](http://www.na-ygn.org/), an organization created to
provide unique opportunities to young professionals in all fields of
nuclear science & technology. Paul has been active in the [American
Nuclear Society](http://www.ans.org/) for over 15 years, including
membership in various committees and chairing the Student Sections
Committee and the Special Committee on Electronic Communications and
Publications. Paul also represented the ANS and NA-YGN at the
[international climate change negotiations](http://unfccc.int/) in
Buenos Aires, Argentina (1998), and Bonn, Germany (1999). He is a member
of the American and Canadian Nuclear Societies, the American Society for
Engineering Education and the NA-YGN.
