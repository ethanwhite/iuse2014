# IUSE Proposal

## Proposal

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) is a volunteer
organization backed by Mozilla and the Sloan Foundation whose aim is
to teach scientists the basic computing skills they need to get more
done in less time, and with less pain.  In the past 12 months alone,
we have run over 100 two-day events for over 4400 people, in which we
cover:

*   the Unix shell (but we're really teaching people how to automate
    repetitive tasks);

*   version control with Git (but we're really teaching them how to
    track and share their work);

*   Python or R (but we're really teaching them how to grow a program in
    a structured, modular, testable, reusable way); and

*   databases (but we're really teaching them the difference between
    structured and unstructured data).

We currently target graduate students, post-docs, and faculty, but
would like to start reaching people at earlier career stages.  In
particular, we would like to run workshops for undergraduate students
taking part in the [NSF REU program](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu)
at or near the start of their time in the lab.  This training will
help them be more productive during their time in REU (graduate
participants typically report that what we teach saves them a day a
week), and also prepare them to work in a world where all aspects of
science are increasingly dependent on computing.

Our curriculum and teaching practices are already evidence-based: the
[training program](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org) we run for
instructors introduces participants to best practices such as peer
instruction, and to underlying concepts such as cognitive load theory
and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, and more specifically to
ongoing work by researchers including Guzdial & Ericson (Georgia
Tech), Simon (UC San Diego), and Petre (Open University, UK).  One
example of how we translate theory into practice is our near-exclusive
reliance on scientists as instructors, and on our insistence on live
coding during teaching as a way of demonstrating and transferring
authentic practice to learners.

In addition, we have been assessing retention and learning outcomes
since the beginning of our Sloan-funded in January 2012.  Work was
begun by Dr. Jorge Aranda (then at the University of Victoria), and is
now being done by Jory Schossau (Michigan State University) in
collaboration with Prof. Julie Libarkin (also MSU).  Schossau and
Libarkin as using both qualitative and quantitative methods to
determine which of the concepts and practices we teach are being
adopted, and how they are changing scientists' work.

If this proposal is successful, we will use funds to:

1. hire graduate student interns to develop domain-specific "capstone"
   curriculum materials suitable for upper-year undergraduates;

2. run workshops at eight sites each year (most likely timed to
   coincide with the start of the summer REU influx); and

3. expand our assessment efforts to compare REU student outcomes with
   those of other learners, to see what impact this training has on
   them compared with non-participant peers, and to assess and improve
   our instructional techniques.

*   Mozilla (Greg Wilson)

## Budget

Before overheads:

*   materials development: $70K/year * 0.5 time * 2 years = $70K
*   assessment: $70K/year * 0.5 time * 4 years = $140K
*   coordination: $50K/year * 1/12 time * 4 years = $17K (rounding up)
*   bootcamps: 8 sites * 1 bootcamp/year * 4 years * $3K/bootcamp = $96K
*   final report: $25K
*   total: $348K

Note: 8 sites because I'd like to run a couple at other schools every year to increase the breadth of our assessment pool.

## Overheads

*   GWU: 52.5%
*   UCB: http://www.spo.berkeley.edu/policy/fa.html
*   UWM: The indirect rate at UW-Madison is 50.5%.  When UW subcontracts to others, we only scrape indirect on the first 25k.

## Background

### From Myles Boylan (NSF program officer):

The program description is purposefully very brief, because the intent
is to impose virtually no constraints on what be proposed.  We are
hoping that this maximum flexibility in addressing the goal of this
program (improved STEM education) will lead to some great project
proposals that did not fit under the predecessor programs.  However,
we are still willing to support projects that did fit under the three
sunsetted programs, STEP, TUES, and WIDER.

Here are some more details:

Budget: There are absolutely no budget restrictions beyond the Grant
Proposal Guide.  You can include equipment that would be needed for
the performance of the project as long as it is specialized, not
standard items that an institution should supply its instructional
faculty.
 
Duration: No more than 5 years.  This is an NSF wide restriction.
 
Programmatic Elements with regard to STEP like proposals: There is a
lack of mention of recruitment (in contrast to retention).  However,
recruitment work is still possible although I would be very careful
about the kinds of activities you put in a proposal.  Basic things
like brochures, high school recruiting visits, and web sites are not
typically effective nor interesting to us.  More substantive activity
involving the instructional faculty such as working with HS faculty
and creating opportunities for early college credit would be more
appealing to investigate.  Retention remains important because most
institutions have pretty good data on the WDF rate for gatekeeper
courses.  So they know the size of the challenge they face.
 
Research Focus: The IUSE description has a greater research focus.
However, we are still interesting in supporting implementation work.
For example, we are committed to implementation efforts at scale and
we see this as ripe ground for research.  The new NSF/ US Dept of Ed
"Common Guidelines for Education R&D" (August, 2013) would be useful
to consider for guiding research projects.  But careful evaluation
data also is useful to us and IUSE is NOT only for education research.
 
We have a large sum available for new projects, equal to the sum of
the budgets of the 3 sunsetted programs.  I cannot predict number of
awards because there are no budget guidelines.  I would expect that
the funding rate would be in the neighborhood of 20%.

### Other Material

Check out
[The Computational Science for Undergraduate Research Experiences (CSURE) Program](https://www.nics.tennessee.edu/CSURE-2014)
funded by NSF:
this program has a different focus than what Software Carpentry
bootcamps might. But this will not be evident on a first-impression
basis to the reviewers/ panel, and so it's a good idea to address in
the proposal.
