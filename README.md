# Teaching STEM Undergraduates to Think Like the Web

## Context

Scientists and engineers invented electronic computers to accelerate
their work, but two generations on, many STEM researchers are still
not computationally competent: they do repetitive tasks manually
instead of automating them, develop software using a methodology best
summarized as "copy, paste, tweak, and pray", and fail to track their
work in any systematic, reproducible way.

Equally, while the World-Wide Web was created by a scientist to help
his peers share information, many still use it primarily as a way to
find and download PDFs.  Even researchers who understand that open
data can fuel new insights often lack the skills needed to create and
provide a reusable data set.  Equally, any discussion of changing
scientific publishing, improving reproducibility, or using the web to
support "science as a service" eventually stumbles over a general lack
of skills.

The general low level of computing skills among STEM researchers
persists for several reasons:

1.  *The curriculum is full.* Undergraduate STEM programs already
    struggle to cover material regarded as core to their field.  While
    many scientists would agree that more material on programming,
    reproducible research, or web-enabled science would be useful,
    there is no consensus on what to take out to make room.

2.  *The blind leading the blind.* Many faculty lack these skills
    themselves, and hence are unable to pass them on.

3.  *Difficulty of assessing impact.* It is easy to say, "This
    discovery could not have been made without use of that
    supercomputer."  It is much harder to attribute specific advances
    in science to prior training in general computing skills.

## Related Work

Several studies of how scientists use computers and the web (FIXME:
citation) have found that most scientists learn what they know about
developing software and using computers and the web in their research
through osmosis and word of mouth. Most training meant to address this
issue does not target scientists' specific needs, places too much
emphasis on programming and number crunching, and/or jumps to advanced
topics before scientists have mastered the basics.

Software Carpentry is the largest effort to date to address these
issues. Originally created as a training program at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in the late 1990s, it is now part of the Mozilla
Science Lab's efforts to help scientists get more done in less time
and with less pain.  Over 100 certified volunteer instructors
delivered two-day intensive workshops to more than 4200 people in 2013
alone, most covering:

*   the Unix shell,
*   version control with Git,
*   programming in Python or R, and
*   using SQL.

What these workshops actually seek to convey, though, is:

*   how to automate repetitive tasks,
*   how to track and share work,
*   how to grow a program in a modular, testable, reusable way, and
*   the difference is between structured and unstructured data.

We have developed our curriculum and teaching practices through
iterative designed informed by the current literature on teaching and
learning best practices.  Our
[instructor training program](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org)
introduces participants to techniques such as peer instruction, and to
underlying concepts such as cognitive load theory and Vygotsky's Zone
of Proximal Development, and to topic-specific work by computing
education researchers including Guzdial & Ericson (Georgia Tech),
Simon (UC San Diego), and Sorva (Aalto University).  One example of
how we translate theory into practice is our near-exclusive reliance
on scientists as instructors, and on our insistence on live coding
during teaching as a way of demonstrating and transferring authentic
practice to learners.

In addition, we have been assessing retention and learning outcomes
since the beginning of our Sloan Foundation-funded in January 2012.
This has included both qualitative and quantitative assessment begun
by Dr. Jorge Aranda (then at the University of Victoria), and
continued by Jory Schossau in collaboration with Prof. Julie Libarkin
(Michigan State University).  This work seeks to determine the degree
to which the concepts and practices we teach are being adopted, and
how they are changing scientists' work.

## Proposal

This proposal builds on Software Carpentry success in developing the
skills of graduate students, post-docs, and faculty.  We designed this
program to:

1.  deliver training to STEM researchers earlier in their career ---
    specifically, to undergraduate students who are highly likely to
    go on to graduate studies and research careers;

2.  conduct formative evaluation of the impact of that training on
    their work and their career paths;

3.  disseminate the resulting curriculum as widely as possible; and

4.  use that initial contact as a starting point for engaging
    participants in other ongoing open science activities.

More specifically, we would like to run workshops for undergraduate
students taking part in the
[NSF REU program](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu) at or near the
start of their time in the lab.  We believe this training will help
them be more productive during their REU (graduate participants
typically report that what we teach saves them a day a week), and also
prepare them to work in a world where all aspects of science are
increasingly dependent on computing.

As part of this project, we will:

1.  Run workshops at eight sites each year for four years, timed to
    coincide with the start of the summer REU influx, for a minimum of
    40 learners per site.  The six home sites for investigators named
    in this proposal (Michigan State U., Utah State U., George
    Washington U., U. New Mexico, UC Berkeley, and U. Wisconsin -
    Madison) will run workshops in each year of the program; two other
    sites will be added each year to increase the diversity of our
    study population.

2.  Expand our assessment efforts to compare REU student outcomes with
    those of other learners, to see what impact this training has on
    them compared with non-participant peers, and to assess and
    improve our instructional techniques.  More specifically, we will
    employ one post-doctoral researcher to monitor participants in
    these workshops and participants in a subset of our regular
    (graduate-level) workshops for comparison purposes.  This
    researcher may also explore ways in which our engagement with
    students changes the outlook and work practices of their faculty
    supervisors (i.e., whether there is upward knowledge transfer).

3.  Hire one graduate student at each of the eight sites each year to
    provide part-time technical support to workshop participants, and
    to develop new "capstone" curricular materials aimed at specific
    disciplines.

4.  Focus part of our ongoing engagement efforts on the students who
    have taken part in our workshops during both the remainder of
    their undergraduate careers and afterward in order to ensure that
    they become part of the broader open science community.  This may
    include helping the students organize and run workshop of their
    own in subsequent years, connecting them with other open science
    projects, introducing them to potential graduate supervisors who
    understand and value their new skills and outlook, etc.

5.  Hire a professional videographer in years 1 and 2 to record and
    edit lectures so that we may make our core curriculum available
    under a Creative Commons license to anyone who wishes to use it
    for self-directed study or in conjunction with novel teaching
    techniques such as flipped classrooms.

6.  Share curricular materials and our studies of the program's impact
    through science education journals, conferences, and other
    channels.
