# Budget

Before overheads:

*   materials development: $70K/year * 0.5 time * 2 years = $70K
*   assessment: $70K/year * 0.5 time * 4 years = $140K
*   coordination: $50K/year * 1/12 time * 4 years = $17K (rounding up)
*   bootcamps: 8 sites * 1 bootcamp/year * 4 years * $3K/bootcamp = $96K
*   final report: $25K
*   total: $348K

Note: 8 sites because I'd like to run a couple at other schools every year to increase the breadth of our assessment pool.

## Overheads

*   GWU: 52.5%
*   UCB: http://www.spo.berkeley.edu/policy/fa.html
*   UWM: The indirect rate at UW-Madison is 50.5%.  When UW subcontracts to others, we only scrape indirect on the first 25k.
