# Budget

*   Bootcamps: 8 sites x 1 bootcamp/year x 4 years x $3K/bootcamp = $96K
*   Assessment (post-doc): $70K/year x 4 years = $280K
*   Graduate interns: $40K/year x 0.5 time x 4/12 month/year x 4 years x 6 sites = $160K
*   Video production: $30K
*   Coordination (Mozilla): $50K/year x 1/12 month/year x 4 years = $17K
*   TOTAL: $583K

Note 1: this is all *before* overheads.

Note 2: this funds a full-time assessment position.  We can cut $140K
from the budget by funding assessment half-time from this grant, and
looking to other sources (Sloan) for more funding; that gets us down
to $443K before overheads.

## Overheads

*   GWU: 52.5%
*   UCB: http://www.spo.berkeley.edu/policy/fa.html
*   UWM: The indirect rate at UW-Madison is 50.5%.  When UW subcontracts to others, we only scrape indirect on the first 25k.
