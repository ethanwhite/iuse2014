Rachel Slaybaugh received a B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Penn State in 2006
where she served as a licensed nuclear reactor operator.
She went on to the University of Wisconsin - Madison to earn an M.S. in 2008 and a Ph.D. in 2011 in the same field,
as well as a certificate in Energy Analysis and Policy.
For her Ph.D. she researched acceleration methods for massively parallel deterministic neutron transport codes.
Her focus was on fixed source solvers,
eigenvalue solvers,
and preconditioners that could efficiently scale to hundreds of thousands of cores.
Dr. Slaybaugh then worked with hybrid (deterministic-Monte Carlo) methods for shielding applications at Bettis Laboratory
while teaching at the University of Pittsburgh as an adjunct faculty member.
Throughout her career Dr. Slaybaugh has been engaged in education and training,
and she plans to continue and expand these activities
in her new role as an Assistant Professor of Nuclear Engineering at UC - Berkeley.
